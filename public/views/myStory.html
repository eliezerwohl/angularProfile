		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been working on websites for many years,  since the days of Homestead, Xanga,  and GeoCities.  
		I’ve always had a desire to do more with this hobby.
		In 2015, I saw an ad for a Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, and I was immediately intrigued. I was impressed by the Javascript based full stack curriculum.
		Ever since I stepped into the first class,  I’ve been hooked. I’ve been coding and improving my skills every day.</p>
		<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since finishing the course, my life has changed.  I was able to leave my previous job and turn what was previously a hobby into a career.  I've also enjoyed being able to create more complex and rewarding side projects.</p>
